        Here's a list of software and hardware that I use on a regular basis.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Every once in a while someone asks me about my development environment
          or has questions about certain hardware. I thought it would be fun to
          list out everything I use here. Keep in mind, I change things around
          quite a bit, but I will try to keep this page updated. If I missed
          anything, please let me know.
